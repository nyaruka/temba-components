 * Access to our realtime messaging socket (centrifugo). The server lives
 * behind the same origin at /ws/connect and authenticates connections with
 * the browser's session cookie (via a server-side connect proxy), so no
 * token handling is needed here.
 *
 * The connection is owned by a SocketManager which is page-scoped - it hangs
 * off `window` rather than any component, so it survives components mounting
 * and unmounting, and vanilla js on the containing page can share the same
 * connection:
 *
 *   const sub = window.sockets.subscribe('notifications:<org>:<user>', (event) => {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   sub.unsubscribe();
 *
 * Any number of subscribers (components or page js) can watch the same
 * channel - the underlying centrifugo subscription is created on first use
 * and torn down when the last subscriber leaves. The connection itself stays
 * open for the life of the page. Each published event arrives as raw JSON.
 *
 * The connection's state is readable too, so a page can tell its user when it
 * has gone quiet rather than silently showing stale data:
 *
 *   window.sockets.onConnectionState((state) => { ... });
