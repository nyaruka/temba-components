/**
 * Central interest registry for live contact state. Components declare what
 * they care about - specific event types or '*' for everything - and this
 * module owns the rest: it holds the single socket subscription per contact
 * (the firehose on "history:<contact-uuid>"), fetches the contact so watchers
 * get an initial value without something having to change, and fans each
 * event out to just the watchers whose interest matches.
 *
 *   const watch = watchContact(uuid, [Events.CONTACT_NAME_CHANGED], (event, contact) => {
 *     ...
 *   });
 *   watch.unsubscribe();
 *
 * Every delivery hands the watcher the current contact alongside the event
 * that triggered it, so watchers can read state without knowing where the
 * data originally came from. The contact is kept current centrally: scalar
 * events are applied to it directly, while events whose full effect isn't in
 * the event payload (see refetchTypes) trigger a refetch. Initial values and
 * refetches arrive through the same handler as live changes, as a delivery
 * with no event, so watchers have a single code path. The fetch happens on
 * every (re)subscribe, including after reconnects, so watchers also catch up
 * on anything missed while offline. When the last watcher for a contact
 * unsubscribes the socket subscription and cached contact are dropped.
 *
 * Wildcard watchers are event-stream consumers (e.g. chat renders history) -
 * they get every live event but no eventless deliveries, and an entry with
 * only those holds no contact and fetches nothing. They keep their own copy
 * instead, applying events to it with applyContactEvent so how an event
 * changes a contact is still defined in one place. Any watcher can pass
 * onSubscribed to be told when the channel goes live, which is where a
 * stream consumer catches up on what it missed while offline.
